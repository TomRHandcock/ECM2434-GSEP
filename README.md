# Exe Marks the Spot (ECM2434)

An web based scavenger hunt game designed to introduce first year students
to the University of Exeter campus during Fresher's Week.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To test the app on a phone or other device from your personal computer,
you can specify the `--host` argument to allow other devices to connect on
the given IP address. To serve the app on all hosts, for example, you can
use `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Firebase deployment

To deploy to Firebase Hosting, you'll need to be logged in to the FirebaseCLI, which you have to install seperate to Angular's CLI.

Run `npm install -g firebase-tools` to install this CLI program.

To log in to firebase, run `firebase login`.

To deploy, you'll need to have run `ng build --prod` to build a production
copy of the app first, then run `firebase deploy`. You may have to follow
the instructions given to you by the CLI if you have not set up the targetFirebase project to deploy to before running the command again.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
